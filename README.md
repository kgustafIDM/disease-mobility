This repository contains the source code and data associated with the submitted paper on spatiotemporal model selection for Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.

The source/ folder contains the Matlab code used to produce the results in the paper. While this code is commented and self-contained, it may require consultation with the author in order to interpret the results and format the input files. A proper package for this code base is forthcoming.

For the time being, a likelihood ratio calculation using the pre-built POTN for all Sierra Leone EBOV genomes can be run by executing the script: EVDmodel_roaddist.m

The data/ folder contains the various databases input for the results. Filenames should be self-explanatory.
